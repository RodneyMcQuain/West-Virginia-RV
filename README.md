# West-Virginia-RV

A small business opportunity in West Virginia arose where outsourced laborers needed close by rental property to put their recreational vehicles. So, I made this program with instruction from my father (a non-programmer) about what it should contain and how it should function. The main purpose of this app is to keep track of a laborer's property position, contact information, bills, and payment status (based on weekly or monthly periods); as well as the general upkeep and utility bills that he would incur for the property as a whole. Some additional features include a view of all clients, unpaid clients, client bills and utility bills, and various calculations relating to revenue.
